# Jazz-Improvisation-with-LSTM

This notebook is a programming exercise of the Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.ai.  In this notebook, we will implement a model that uses an LSTM to generate music. We will even be able to listen to our own music at the end of the assignment.

**We will learn to:**

- Apply an LSTM to music generation.
- Generate our own jazz music with deep learning.
